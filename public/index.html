    <h1>History of Web Design</h1>

    <p>
      The dark ages of web designs took place in 1989 where screens consisted of just nothing but a few pixels on black screens
      I find it very interesting what progress has been made in such a short amount of time as we go ahead to 1995 where
      we find the birth of browsers that could display images. The next year we discovered Flash exceeding previous limitations
      of existing web design. Designers could make any shapes, layouts, animations and much more further increasing the limits
      of web design.

    <h2>Mobile Uprising</h2>

    <p>
      Flash quickly becomes outdated as Apple decides to abandon it on their first iPhone in 2007. Causing Flash to decay for web
      design.The challenge with internet on mobile devices was the speed and rate which your wallets would be drained because
      all the internet interaction on these devices were quite expensive. Then this guy named Ethan Marcotte decided to challenge
      the existing approach by suggesting we use the same content but different layouts and invented the term Responsive
      web design. Which we still use today which is quite impressive and was a great advancement for web designers.

    <h2>The Bright Future</h2>

    <p>
      After reading the article and learning about the extensive history of web design I know for a fact that designers are not
      even close to really discovering new concepts and becoming even more advanced in technology. Technically there a few
      newe concepts that support the move into the direction of a more flexible and simpler web in CSS like vh, vw that allow
      a much greater flexibilty to position important factors in the web designs. Another great concept in CSS is something
      called Flexbox which allows us to create layouts and modify them wit a single property instead of just writing more
      code. As we advance we will discover new and better ways to produce easier and more effiecient workflow and furthur
      our limits on web design.
